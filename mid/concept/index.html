		This is where the introduction text will be, explaining a little bit about what git is, its history, and more.
		<br>
		<br>
		For now, I am going to use this section to talk about this proof of concept page. <br>
		Here, the main thing that I am testing for is making sure that the general layout of the site is somthing that I 
		am comfortable with and is doable.  The main parts of the actual page that I want to verify are the nav-bar, 
		acordians, and including images as an example element alongside blocks of text (like the stuff that is occupying 
		the current space).  Another thing that I want to include in this proof of concept is breaking up chunks of code 
		into seperate files so that things like headers can be shared across different files.  There are still some style 
		choices that I am wrestling with - colors, how much should the headers be indented compared to the content.  But 
		the important part is that I'm sure now that I can do it and that future stylistic changes will be simple to implement. 
		Making sure the design is relatively modular means that having just one working page lends itself to meaning that 
		all subsequent pages are created easily. <br>
		Going forward, I wish to implement scrollspy (which my group worked with), as well as fix the an issue with the 
		navbar dropdown not working for some weird reason. I spent hours on it and it just isn't working. (Future Nick: got it working) <br>
		Also, I want to keep the Helvetivca font. It's soooo nice to read. Please give me feedback on what I might be missing, 
		especially for getting this to look smooth on mobile. I plan on using our methods from class.
